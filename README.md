- 👋 Hi, I’m Vladimir or Vladi in short. I'm originally from Moscow, Russia, but since 2020 I live in Munich.
- 👀 I’m interested in making BC and DYCE apps better and cooler
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DYCE apps and how stuff works around CI/CD and AppSource release pipeline
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on those topics, share my experience and exchange ideas
- 📫 How to reach me: just msg me in Teams or write email (I like PGP signed emails, cool yeah!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: _In Russia it is probably colder than where you are. And you can go to jail for a retweet or a blog post._
